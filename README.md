# Project Overview

This project serves 2 main purposes. The first purpose is to give students direction in what careers their interests lean them towards. The second purpose is to give teachers and schools a better idea where their student’s interests lie. To do this, we created a quiz that presents the user with a dynamic range of questions that measures what subjects they have a strong interest for.  To access this quiz, they first have to register an account. Afterwards, they are able to access the results in drop-down menu form, and can retake the quiz to their heart’s content. The results rank their interests in order from most interested to least interested. They can then have these results be viewed by a teacher/professor, which will aid them in guiding their child towards the future.
