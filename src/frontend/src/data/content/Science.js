##### Top Career Paths

* Epidemiologist/Medical Scientist (Median Salary: $75,000)

    * Epidemiologists examine the causes of diseases to prevent them from transmitting and recurring, including investigating the triggers of an infection for a public health agency or collecting blood samples at an outpatient care center. These medical scientists might work in hospitals, laboratories or universities, or for pharmaceutical companies or health insurers.

* Psychologist (Median Salary: $106,000)

    * Psychologists study cognitive, emotional, and social processes and behavior by observing, interpreting, and recording how people relate to one another and to their environments. They use their findings to help improve processes and behaviors.

* Forensic Science Technician (Median Salary: $61,000)

    * Forensic science technician is a blanket name for a number of professionals, who might work in the auspices of forensic science. Crime scene investigators, who gather and document evidence at a crime scene, fall under this forensic science umbrella, as do criminalists, who are scientists who primarily work in a laboratory analyzing the evidence. Professionals in this field can also specialize in forensic entomology, anthropology, engineering and more.

* Biochemist (Median Salary: $94,000)

    * Biochemists study the chemical structure of living things, such as proteins, DNA, and cells. They use their research to help understand the causes of diseases and to develop new medicines.

* Archaeologist (Median Salary: $66,000)

    * At its most basic, archaeology is the study of prehistory and human history through the excavation and analyzation of artifacts. There is some methodical digging involved, but the bulk of an archaeologist's work will be done in the lab, analyzing excavated remains.
