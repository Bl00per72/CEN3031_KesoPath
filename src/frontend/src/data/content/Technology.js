#####  Top Career Paths

* Information Security Analyst (Median Salary: $103,590) 

    * Information security analysts are the gatekeepers or security guards of information systems. They prevent, monitor and respond to data breaches and cyberattacks, which are becoming more common

* Software Developer (Median Salary: $110,140)

    * Software developers invent the technologies we sometimes take for granted. For instance, that app that rings, sings or buzzes you out of a deep sleep every morning? A software developer helped design that. And when you roll into the office and turn on your computer, clicking and scrolling through social media, music and your personal calendar – software developers had a big hand in shaping those, too.

* Data Scientist (Median Salary: $98,230)

    * Data scientists use technology to glean insights from large amounts of data they collect. It’s a field that requires statistics, quantitative reasoning and computer programming skills. 

* IT Manager (Median Salary: $151,150)

    * Computer and information systems managers, or information technology managers, are the guides who help organizations navigate the always-changing labyrinth that is modern technology. These all-important employees deliver short- and long-term visions for the company's technology needs and goals.

* Computer Systems Analyst (Median Salary: $93,730) 

    * Computer systems analysts leverage both their knowledge of information technology and business to design better computer systems and processes for their clients. And although these professionals have many responsibilities, their first task is to understand their client's business, whether it's an organization in Silicon Valley or a firm on Wall Street.

* Web Developer (Median Salary: $77,200)

    * Web developers are responsible for creating websites. When these artists do their jobs well, everything about a site seems to fit together superbly, from the colors and graphics, to the images and special effects (or "animation," to those in the know), to the navigation.
